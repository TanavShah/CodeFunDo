# One Tap Help 
### Introduction 
An offline app which sends the exact location of the person trapped in a disaster to the rescue team, thereby helping the rescue team to easily carry out its functions. This app can also be used to find the location of a victim, if found by some other user. The app uses an SMS from the user, to ask for help. 
### How the app works
###### For people asking for help
  The victim interacts with the app and asks for help by sending his GPS location to the server through cellular network in a single tap.     No internet is required. The server stores the information in an organized manner. 
 ###### For people who want to help (including rescue forces)
 The rescue team requests the server to get the location of people who need their help. The information which was stored in the database is   filtered and then sent to the rescuer. After the people are saved, people delete their query.
